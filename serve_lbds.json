    "abstract": "In this paper we present Virtuoso Strings, a dataset for timing analysis and automatic music transcription (AMT) tasks requiring note onset annotations. This dataset takes advantage of real-world recordings in multitrack format and is curated as part of the Augmented Reality Music Ensemble (ARME) project which investigates musician synchronisation and multimodal music analysis. The dataset is comprised of repeated recordings of quartet, trio, duet and solo ensemble performances with different temporal expressions and leadership role assignments, providing new possibilities for developing and evaluating AMT models with respect to diverse musical performance styles. To reduce the cost of the labour-intensive manual annotation, a semi-automatic method was utilised for both annotation and quality control. The presented dataset consists of 746 tracks with a total of 68,728 onsets. Every track includes onset annotations for a single string instrument, enabling the creation of audio files with different combinations of instruments to be used in the AMT evaluation process.",

    "abstract": "We present Music Scope Pad, an application for efficiently discovering what one wants to view among many unknown music videos (MVs). Current video players only enable the user to view one MV at a time, so to explore what the user wants to view among many unknown MVs, they need to play each MV individually, which requires a large amount of manipulation. Our app features artificial-intelligence processing of video acquired with the device's front camera to detect the natural movements of the user's head and hands while listening to music, enabling the user to explore MVs. Ten MVs are played simultaneously on the iPad screen and through the spatial acoustics of the device. The user can then explore the MVs they want to view by moving their head left or right. The volume of each MV through the spatial acoustics is automatically adjusted so that the MVs closer to the center of the screen are louder. If the user then cups their hands around their ears, as if they were listening carefully, they can hear the MVs directly in front of them on the screen through the spatial acoustics with more emphasis. If the user keeps their focus on one MV for more than three seconds, that MV will be selected and only that video will be played from the beginning. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a transformer machine-learning model trained with a large dataset of chord sequences. The dataset includes several styles, such as jazz, rock, pop, blues, or music for cinema, among others. We investigated three modeling strategies: 1) We started the tokenization method by treating all different chords as unique elements, which resulted in a vocabulary of 5202 independent chords as tokens. 2) We expressed the chords as a tuple describing root, nature (e.g., major, minor, diminished, major seventh), and extensions (e.g., additions, alterations), which produces a vocabulary of 59 tokens. 3) We extended the second model by complementing the transformer model with chord information containing eight MIDI notes added to the positional embeddings. We analyze sequences generated by comparing them with the training dataset using trigram analysis, which reveals common chord progressions and source duplications. Secondly, we compared the generated sequences from a musical perspective, rating their plausibility concerning the training data. The third strategy reported lower validation loss and more musical consistency in the suggested progressions.",

    "abstract": "Cornelissen et al. (2021) propose representing melodic contour using a linear combination of few cosine functions for a variety of tasks such as visualization, classification and summarization. The authors apply this representation to studying melodies from four traditions (Gregorian chant, German, Chinese and Sioux folk songs) and claim that it provides a common ground for comparing contours across traditions due to its being data independent, i.e., culturally neutral. We study this claim in the domain of Irish Traditional Dance Music and find evidence that challenges its veracity. Specifically, we find that the cosine representation of the melodic contours of this music is not nearly as efficient as it is for the other traditions. We contrast this representation with a principal component analysis of the melodic contours. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of cosine-based representations of melodic contour.",

    "abstract": "Rhythm-based video games challenge players to match their actions with musical cues, turning songs into interactive experiences. The design of the game charts, which dictate the timing and placement of on-screen notes, are manually crafted by players and developers. With AutoOsu, we introduce a CRNN-based model for generating rhythm game charts for a given audio track, conditioned on an intended difficulty level. In previous studies, this task is often divided into two: onset detection, which determines timing points for notes; and action generation, where notes are distributed among a set of available keys. These two sub-tasks are typically handled with two separately trained models, and audio information is only given to the onset detection model. We instead jointly train the two recurrent layers who both receive audio information, which streamlines the training process and helps better utilize musical features.",

Specifically, we first pre-train a transformer-based model with the Slakh2100 dataset to initialize its weights. We then fine-tune the model by training using the target datasets. We compare our approach with the adaptor approach, widely known as effective in fine-tuning large language models. We also investigate how the IR performance changes when we can access only a limited number of samples from the target dataset. Our experiment shows that the weight initialization performs consistently better than training from scratch and the adaptor approach.",

    "abstract": "The improvement of automatic transcription algorithms has led to the accessibility of high-quality symbolic music data aligned with audio, especially for piano music. However, the transcribed MIDI files need extra annotation, such as beat, chord, and structure, to utilize the dataset in other MIR tasks, such as automatic music composition, melody harmonization, and harmonic analysis. Music annotations, especially chord annotations, need high-level music domain knowledge. Although there are a handful of algorithms for chord annotation, the prediction accuracy is limited. Therefore, it needs humans to correct the annotation eventually. We suggest a web-based semi-automated chord annotation tool for piano music to facilitate this validation process conveniently. We integrated the previous piano music transcription, alignment, quantization, and chord annotation research into one system. Given piano audio input, users can modify the predicted chord annotation of converted MIDI. The demo page is available in our website.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the evaluation for the automatic lyric transcription (ALT) task. We argue that existing lyric transcription benchmarks, primarily focusing on word content, may overlook the complex nuances of written lyrics. This leads to potential misalignment between the creative process of musicians and songwriters as well as listeners' experiences. For example, the absence of line breaks can strip the lyrics of their original rhythm, emotional emphasis, and rhyme scheme. To address this issue, we introduce JamALT, a new lyrics transcription benchmark based on the JamendoLyrics dataset. This includes an enhanced version of the data, geared specifically towards ALT evaluation by implementing music industry's transcription and formatting guidelines for lyrics, particularly in terms of punctuation, line breaks, letter case, and non-word vocal sounds. We also propose a suite of evaluation metrics beyond traditional word error rate, which are designed to capture the aforementioned issues. We hope that the proposed benchmark contributes to the ALT task, enabling more precise and reliable assessments of transcription systems and enhancing the user experience in lyrics applications such as subtitle renderings for live captioning or karaoke.",

    "abstract": "Style transfer, in the context of music generation, has been primarily enabled through content-style disentanglement. However, a notable limitation of existing disentanglement models is their confinement to short musical clips, typically spanning only a few bars. In this late-breaking demo, we propose and formalize a novel idea of modular style prior modelling to bridge this research gap. Our focus centres on the specific task of accompaniment arrangement, beginning with AccoMontage, a piano arranger that leverages chord-texture disentanglement and a primitive, rule-based style planner to maintain a long-term texture structure. Subsequently, we introduce Q&A-XL, a multi-track orchestrator with a more generic latent style prior model, which characterizes the global structure of orchestration style. From end to end, the complete system is named AccoMontage-3, which is capable of generating full-band accompaniment for whole pieces of music, with cohesive multi-track arrangement and coherent long-term structure.",

    "abstract": "Learning the harmonic structure of music is crucial for various music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. Word2vec skip-gram, a well-established technique in natural language processing, has been found to effectively learn harmonic concepts in music. It represents music slices in a vector space, preserving meaningful geometric relationships. These embeddings hold great promise as inputs for MIR tasks, particularly automatic chord recognition (ACR). However, ACR research predominantly focuses on audio data due to the limited availability of well-annotated symbolic music datasets. In this work, we propose an innovative approach utilizing the Harmony Transformer (HT) architecture by Chen and Su. Instead of incorporating input embedding within the network, we leverage skip-gram as an unsupervised embedding technique. Our experiments show that this unsupervised method produces embeddings that adeptly capture harmonic concepts. We also introduce a novel visualization method to assess the fidelity of these embeddings in representing harmonic musical concepts. We perform our experiments on the Lakh MIDI and the BPS-FH dataset.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to debilitate the enjoyment of music for both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals by visually representing music. In order to effectively and distinctively portray the musical rhythm, we focus on Chironomie, a conducting technique used in Gregorian chant. Generally, Chironomie is drawn by a curve that corresponds to the musical score, and this curve is determined by whether a short segment of the score represents one of two classes: Arsis or Thesis. In pursuit of our objective, our endeavors encompass two essential facets: the adaptation of Chironomie for Western tonal music to express intuitively perceivable musical features like tension and relaxation, and the evaluation whether Chironomie can effectively convey music visually. We report an automated method for estimating Arsis and Thesis within composite beats to generate Chironomie. Additionally, it presents evaluation experiments involving normal-hearing to assess the effectiveness of Chironomie.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly expanding field of music information retrieval (MIR), automatic transcription remains one of the most sought-after capabilities, especially for songs that employ multiple instruments. Musscribe emerges as a state-of-the-art transcription tool that addresses this challenge by integrating three distinct methodologies: demixing, harmonic dilated convolution, and joint beat tracking. Demixing is employed to isolate individual instruments within a song by separating overlapping audio sources, thus ensuring each instrument is transcribed distinctly. Beat tracking is then run as a parallel process to extract the joint beat and downbeat estimations. These processes results in an output midi file, which is then quantized using information derived from the beat tracking. As such, this method paves the way for more accurate and sophisticated analyses, bridging the gap between human and machine understanding of music. Together, these methodologies allow us to produce transcriptions that are not only accurate but also highly representative of the original compositions. Preliminary tests and evaluations showcase the potential in transcribing complex musical pieces with high fidelity, outperforming many contemporary tools in the market. This innovative approach not only has implications for music transcription but also for broader applications in audio analysis, remixing, and digital music production. The model has been instrumental in accelerating the composition process for several Norwegian television shows. Moreover, its efficacy can be observed in the Netflix series \"A Storm for Christmas.\" Renowned composer Peter Baden harnessed this tool to enhance his workflow, proving the demand for innovative tools like this in the professional music industry.

    "abstract": "Recently, multi-band spectrogram-based approaches such as Band-Split RNN (BSRNN) have demonstrated promising results for music source separation. In our recent work, we introduce the BS-RoFormer model which inherits the idea of band-split scheme in BSRNN at the front-end, and then uses the hierarchical Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to model the inner-band and inter-band sequences for multi-band mask estimation. This model has achieved state-of-the-art performance, but the band-split scheme is defined empirically, without analytic supports from the literature. In this paper, we propose Mel-RoFormer, which adopts the Mel-band scheme that maps the frequency bins into overlapped subbands according to the mel scale. In contract, the band-split mapping in BSRNN and BS-RoFormer is non-overlapping and designed based on heuristics. Using the MUSDB18HQ dataset for experiments, we demonstrate that Mel-RoFormer outperforms BS-RoFormer in the separation tasks of vocals, drums, and other stems.",

A more complex form of interactive synchronization occurs when listeners tap out rhythmic patterns using their fingers, hands, or even some form of improvised drumsticks.

We employed datasets comprising of mridangam strokes, some artificially generated through simulations using a browser application in which the strokes can be generated by typing the syllables on a text window, and others recorded authentically. We investigate the effectiveness of clustering techniques on the task of stroke classification. Additionally, pre-trained residual neural networks (ResNet) were also examined by fine-tuning them on the task. Our initial findings, supported by existing literature, underscore the necessity of introducing additional steps to address composite strokes (strokes created by combining two basic strokes) and accommodate full-length recordings of the mridangam. We also delved into the task of audio segmentation using onset detection techniques as part of our broader exploration within this context. Our aim was to segment mridangam recordings into individual strokes. Our preliminary finding suggests that utilizing spectral flux for onset detection, coupled with a post-processing step involving a local average computation step, produced promising results. ",

    "abstract": "We present two inverted dictation ear training games, now included in the upgraded Troubadour platform for music theory learning. The Troubadour platform offers e-learning games for ear training in rhythm, intervals and harmonies in an open-sourced and user-centred environment. With now added inverted dictation games, the platform offers a new modality of ear training, which enables the students to practice their voice or instruments individually without the necessity of the teacher's presence while practicing.",

    "abstract": "We propose \\textit{Coco-Mulla}, a plug-and-play module that adds direct content-based controls (chords, drums, and piano-roll) to existing text-to-music large language models, e.g.  MusicGen. Coco-Mulla employs the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, which only requires fine-tuning with fewer than 4\\% of the original model's parameters on a dataset containing fewer than 300 songs. Experiments show that our approach achieves effective content-based controls while keeping the quality of generated music. Furthermore, by combining content-based controls and text descriptions, our system achieves flexible music variation generation and style transfer. \\footnote{Our source codes and demos are available at \\url{https://kikyo-16.github.io/coco-mulla}.}",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly revolutionized Natural Language Processing. At Utopia, we developed \u201cEnhance Lyrics\u201d, a lyrics-based mood/theme detection and keyword generation tool, which combines predictions from LLMs with  smaller transformer models. Specifically, instead of fine tuning the LLMs for our downstream tasks, we use them in a zero-shot fashion, followed by a much smaller  transformer finetuned with our downstream task datasets. Our research suggests a hybrid approach can enhance performance compared to leveraging only LLMs. ",

    "abstract": "It is standard practice to use spectrograms as input features for discriminating MIR tasks. However, recent research showed using representations produced by Jukebox (a music language model) led to better model performance. This was tested on music tagging, genre classification, key detection, emotion recognition, and music transcription. In this paper, we test it on beat and downbeat tracking. Specifically, we compare compressed Jukebox embeddings with spectrograms as input to a model that jointly predicts beat, downbeat, and tempo. Experiments show that the two inputs bring comparable results for beat tracking, while using Jukebox embeddings leads to significant improvements for downbeat tracking.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the application of deep learning methods to guitar effect modelling has garnered considerable attention. Motivated by recent advancements in neural vocoders, we experimented with two different discriminator architectures in replacement of the discriminator employed in an existing GAN-based guitar amplifier modelling framework, for better audio quality. We report the preliminary result of evaluating these methods on the audio samples of 3 amplifiers from the EGDB dataset.",

    "abstract": "We present an automatic accompaniment method for lead sheets, allowing a user to play along to a favorite piece of music in a semi-improvised manner. We realize this by combining a score follower with a downbeat phase tracker, using a score follower to track at a harmony level, while the exact position inside the measure is narrowed down by a downbeat tracker. The two information sources are fused by model averaging. To prevent the downbeat tracker from tracking tempi at octaves of the correct tempo, the downbeat tracker is conditioned on the target bpm of the performance. We will present a live demo.",
